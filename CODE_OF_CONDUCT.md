# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Welcome to nimbus, where our goal is to make testing not only efficient but also enjoyable! This Code of Conduct is here to ensure we all have a great time while keeping things friendly and respectful. Think of it as the rules for a really awesome party where everyone’s invited!

## Our Standards

We expect everyone to follow these groovy guidelines:

1. **Be Respectful**: Treat everyone like you’d want your favorite pizza to be treated—gently and with lots of respect. No throwing pizza slices (or insults).

2. **Be Inclusive**: Imagine we’re all at a big, colorful carnival. We want everyone to enjoy the rides, so let’s make sure no one’s left out. Be kind, be welcoming, and bring everyone into the fun!

3. **Be Professional**: Channel your inner superhero—calm, collected, and ready to save the day. Keep disagreements low-key and work together like a team of superheroes on a mission.

4. **Be Supportive**: Be like the best friend who’s always there to help with homework or lend a hand. Share your wisdom, offer a hand, and cheer on your fellow testers like they’re winning a gold medal.

5. **Be Honest**: Honesty is our superpower. Be straight with your feedback, admit when you’ve made a mistake, and let’s work together to make things better. No need for secret identities here!

## Unacceptable Behavior

Here’s what to avoid—think of it as the “no-fun” zone:

- **Harassment or Discrimination**: No one likes a bad apple. Treat everyone fairly and with kindness, no matter who they are or where they come from.

- **Threats or Intimidation**: Keep your supervillain tendencies at bay. No threats, no bullying—just good vibes.

- **Sharing Private Info**: Respect privacy like it’s the last piece of cake—don’t share it without permission.

- **Disruptive Behavior**: Let’s not turn the party into a circus. Avoid behavior that messes up the fun for others.

- **Abuse**: Physical or verbal abuse is a big no-no. We’re here for a good time, not for any kind of abuse.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If something goes awry or you spot a problem, let us know! We’re here to sort things out and keep the party going smoothly. Here’s how to report issues:

### Reporting Process

1. **Send Us a Message**: Describe what happened, include any relevant details, and email us at [07narguiles.visieres@icloud.com](mailto:07narguiles.visieres@icloud.com). It’s like sending a friendly note to let us know how we can help.

2. **Review Time**: Our team will check out the report and might ask for more info—just like when you ask for more details on a really interesting story.

3. **Resolution**: We’ll handle the situation and decide on the best way to fix things. Actions could range from a friendly reminder to a time-out, depending on what happened.

### Confidentiality

We promise to keep your reports as secret as your favorite secret recipe. We’re all about keeping things private and making sure everyone feels safe and respected.
